Remember that a computer does what we tell it to do, which is often not what we want it to do!

    "To confirm our results we are going to create our first quality plot. For this we will piece together things learned in PreLab01 and Lab00 along with some new rules. You should review what we have already learned as we will build on those now. In particular, the code for generating plots using figures and axes discussed in PreLab01 must be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some general rules to follow. There are, of course, exceptions to these suggestions but in general they should be followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each line in a figure should be distinct and easily recognizable. This means using different colors, styles, or both. Just changing colors may not be sufficient. It is still the case that many publications are printed in black and white, further, about 7-10 percent of people are (red-green) color blind. In matplotlib the `plot` function provides many options for changing the look of lines and markers. When you look at the documentation the most basic way of calling plot that allows changes is to include a format specifier. For example `plot(x, y, ‘k-’)` will plot a solid, black line. For purely online plots using different colors is often sufficient and has become common practice, though will be less useful for color blind readers. If the plot may appear in print then it will frequently appear in black and white. Thus it is best to use different line styles in addition to changing color. For example, specifying the format `r--` will produce a dashed, red line.\n",
    "2. When there are multiple lines in a figure, each line should be labeled. This can be done using the `label` keyword. It should provide a short description of what the line represents. The label is used to create a legend in the figure. This can be included by, not surprisingly, using the `legend` function.\n",
    "3. All figures must include labels on the axes and a title. Any figure that is not a \"quick plot\" that you create for a lab must have these! In general it is a good idea to include them in any figure you end up saving as an image file. When you later come back and wonder what this file is, having clear labels and legends will help.\n",
    "4. There are many other things that can be done to polish figures. We have already discussed using `minorticks_on`. Another minor polishing is that I often find the default line thickness to be too small. This can be changed using the `linewidth` or `lw` keyword to `plot`."

    "### Rant\n",
    "\n",
    "Producing quality figures is somewhat subjective. Even so, the number of very low quality plots found in articles submitted for publication is appalling. Bad figures are easy to spot and it is also easy to avoid making them. This is particularly true when we use tools with good defaults, like matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or at least mostly good defaults. A change made a number of years ago now that I completely disagree with for scientific figures is how tick marks are handled. In your figure you should see that tick marks point outward from the plotting region and they only appear on the left and bottom axes. Though I greatly prefer them pointing inward, one could argue that this is a matter of taste.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, not having tick marks on the right and top axes is atrocious (to put it mildly). In a scientific figure we are typically interested in the behavior of what we are plotting over the full range of the plot. Thus we want to be able to read off values of curves even if they are near the top or right hand side of the plot. Without tick marks on these axes this is extremely difficult, it makes reading plots much harder. I do not know the rationale for this change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this I will always change the behavior (back to that in previous versions of matplotlib). Fortunately, matplotlib allows you to control everything. There are a few ways to do this. I will use the `rc` interface for achieving my desired look. This globally changes the behavior for all plots. In all subsequent notebooks you will see the extra boilerplate to set up my preferences:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib as mpl\n",
    "mpl.rc('xtick', direction='in', top=True)\n",
    "mpl.rc('ytick', direction='in', right=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "I also pretty much always want the minor ticks turned on so I will also include\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mpl.rc('xtick.minor', visible=True)\n",
    "mpl.rc('ytick.minor', visible=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is somewhat a matter of taste, it will not be enforced. However, I would encourage you to think about this and other choices whenever you produce a figure. There are many other choices, existing styles, *etc*. that satisfy the same goal of clear plots. Any of them could also be used. There are other default behaviors that could also be changed to improve plot quality if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Online Figures\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion above and preferences I choose are based on the idea that a figure is going to appear in print. More and more often these days that is not the case. Further, a notebook is an \"online\" document so maybe it does not need to be treated like a \"print\" document. Many styles designed for online viewing are in common use (particularly in data science it seems). Matplotlib makes it fairly easy to select such a style for all plots and could be included in your \"boiler plate\". I will leave it to you to find out more about this if you are interested .... Regardless, the style of your plots must be such that for any feature that would appear in the upper portion and/or right hand side of the plot, we can easily read off its $x$ and $y$ values without having to imprecisely trace \"by hand\" or \"by eye\" across the figure to tick marks far from the feature."
